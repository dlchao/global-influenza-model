Description of the Global Model of influenza transmission
by Eben Kenah and Dennis Chao

1. Introduction

The Global Model can be used to model the transmission of a new strain 
of influenza around the globe.  

2. Requirements

The model is written in Python and requires the numpy library 
(http://numpy.scipy.org) to be installed.

3. Quick start

The source file "global_model8.py" contains all of the model code.
The default settings assume that there is a directory "DataFiles"
that contains information about the cities in the model, the
influenza season of these cities, and the passenger travel volume
among these cities.  We recommend using the defaults: 
population_321_age.txt, seasonality_321.csv, and travel_321.txt.

To run the model in Python, create a globalModel object.  For
example, to initialize a global model with normal seasonality and an
maximum R0 of 1.5:
  > import global_model as globalmodel
  > Erth = globalmodel.season_globalModel(name='R0 = 1.5', R0=1.5, lowR0=0.8, popFile = 'DataFiles/population_321_age.txt',travelFile = 'DataFiles/travel_321.txt', sympTratio=0.25, exchangeArrayList=True, randomSeed=1)

To run the model, use the global_epidemic method.  To start an epidemic
in Mexico City with 100 infected individuals on January 1, using the
model initialized as above:
  > Erth.global_epidemic(starttime=1, imprtList=[("Mexico_City", 100)])
The model can take about 15-20 minutes to run.

After the model is done, the results are stored in the globalModel
object.  you can output the results to text files using the 
write_global method of the global_csv object, which is defined in the 
global_csv.py file.  If you call:
  > global_csv.write_global(Erth, "out")
you will get the following output files:
    out-args.csv, which summarizes the parameters for the model run.
    out-r.csv, which outputs the number of susceptible people each day in
    	       each city.
    out-i.csv, which outputs the number of infected people each day in
    	       each city.
    out-r.csv, which outputs the number of recovered people each day in
    	       each city.
    out-r4.csv, which outputs the number of recovered people each day in
    	       each city by subpopulation and risk group.
    out-exchange.csv, which outputs the number of infected people who 
    	       travel between each pair of cities each day.  This file
	       can only be output when the globalModel object has its
 	       exchangeArrayList member variable set to True.

4. Class list

epiList - Influenza transmission model for a single city.

globalModel - Base class for all global models.  Creates and manages
an array of epiLists.

step_globalModel - The influenza season of all cities north of the 
Tropic of Cancer is from October 1 to March 31, all cities south of
the Tropic of Capricorn is from April 1 to September 30, and all
cities between the two tropics is always in-season.  Transmissibility
is high in-season and low out-of-season.

linear_globalModel - same as step_globalModel except that there is
a 30-day transition when transmissibility changes at the beginning
and at the end of influenza season in the temperate areas.

season_globalModel - uses a seasonality data file to determine the
transmissibility of influenza for each city and each day of the year.

prevac_globalModel - same as season_global_model, but prevaccinates
a fraction of the population.

vacfile_globalModel - same as season_global_model, but vaccinates 
individuals based on the contents of an input file, which specifies
the timing and the fraction of the population of each city to vaccinate
